This project used Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals creating a representative model of weather across world cities. 

To accomplish this, I utilized OpenWeatherMap, citipy library, Matplotlib and Pandas to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.

Ruby on Rails was used to deploy the application to Heroku.

## Summary

* The plot on Latitude vs Temperature shows that the temperature is highest at the equator and lowest at the poles.

* The humidity at the equator is in the range from 50%-100%. However, the trends does not change based on the latitude.

* There seems to be no co-relation of cloudliness with respect to the latitude.

* The windspeed for most cities fall under 20mph and there seems to be no trend on the windspeed with respect to the latitude.
